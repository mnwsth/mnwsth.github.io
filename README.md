This is a version of [**Beautiful Jekyll**](https://beautifuljekyll.com) by [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com) that incorporates some [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/)
that I was interested in. In addition, a few stylistic changes, especially wrt the footer, and font 
colors  and sizes have also been done. 

In addition to what you can do with Beautiful Jekyll, below are a few more configurations 
that you can set in `_config.yml` 

## Additional features
* Add link to google scholar. 
* Add link to CV in the footer.
* Add a link to your personal DBLP profile.
