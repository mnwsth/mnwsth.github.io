<h1>Manu Awasthi</h1>
I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science 
at Ashoka University. 

Please bear with me while I get a rudimentary version of this 
webpage up and running. 

In the meanwhile,  feel free to browse through my research papers on
 <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AaMBbMMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Google Scholar</a>, a profile at <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/manuawasthi">Linkedin</a>, or my personal <a href="https://twitter.com/mnwsth">twitter account</a>.
